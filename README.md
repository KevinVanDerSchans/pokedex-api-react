### **_Pokédex_** is a responsive App connected to the Pokémon public API.

- **Intuitive user interface**: The frontend provides an intuitive and easy-to-use user interface for users to interact with the application and view the list of the Pokemon with their respective information.

- **Data visualization**: data is displayed in a clear and organized manner, using appropriate components and styles.

## Features

The ***user*** will be able to:

- See the complete **list** of all Pokemon from the PokéAPI, where the user can see the name, the id, a GIF and the type it belongs to.

- If the user decides to click on any Pokemon, a **Details** page will be dynamically created to display the **details** of the Pokemon. Apart from the data mentioned above, the user will also see the **stats** (weight, height, HP, attack, defense, special-attack, special-defense and speed) and a **button** to return to the Home page.

- Select the **number of items** per page to be displayed in the list (in this case, between 20, 50, 100 and 150 Pokemon).

- **Navigate** through the structured **pagination** (it has buttons for next page, previous page, next 2 options, previous 2 options, go to the first page and go to the last page).

- **Filter** all Pokemon by **Type**. Among the options, there are: Normal, Fighting, Flying, Poison, Ground, Rock, Bug, Ghost, Steel, Fire, Water, Grass, Electric, Psychic, Ice, Dragon, Dark and Fairy.

- **Search** for a Pokemon by name or id.

- Play a **playlist** with 6 Pokemon songs. At the same time, the user has a **button** in the header to activate/deactivate 2 GIFs and make the Pokemon **dance** to the rhythm of the music.

- In case the user enters an invalid path or searches for a Pokemon that does not exist, an **Error page** will provide feedback.
